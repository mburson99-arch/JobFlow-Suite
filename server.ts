      critiqueMarkdown: `Your original resume, while containing valuable transferable skills, needed significant re-framing to present you as a viable candidate for an IT Support role, especially as a career changer. Here's the breakdown:

*   **Professional Summary:** The original summary was too generic. Phrases like 'transitioning into IT' are fine, but it lacked specific technical keywords and didn't immediately connect your 5 years of remote operational experience to the *needs of an IT department. It didn't articulate how your operational expertise would directly benefit an IT role.
*   **Technical Skills:** Listing soft skills here dilutes the impact of your hard technical skills. More importantly, the specific tools and technologies mentioned in the job description (e.g., ServiceNow, SCCM, Meraki, macOS/Linux) were either absent or only vaguely alluded to. 'Multi-VM Architecture' is better demonstrated in a project, not just a skill list.
*   **Featured Technical Project:** This was your strongest asset, but the original framing could have been more explicit about how it mimics enterprise environments and directly addresses IT support tasks. It didn't fully leverage the opportunity to showcase your hands-on experience as a direct answer to the job description's technical requirements.
*   **Professional Experience:** While your experience had excellent transferable skills (SLA management, field troubleshooting, incident resolution, documentation, technical translation, escalation), the descriptions often focused on the logistics/claims aspect rather than emphasizing the underlying process, problem-solving, and technical aptitude that would translate to IT. For instance, 'Field Troubleshooting' in your Operations role was described generally, not with the specific IT-centric language that would resonate with an IT manager. The 'Technical Adaptability' bullet was great but could have been integrated more seamlessly.
*   **Alignment with JD:** The original resume didn't proactively map your existing skills and lab work to the job description's explicit requirements (e.g., GPO for patch management, ServiceNow/Jira for ticketing, specific networking components, hardware troubleshooting). The absence of any mention or implication of macOS or Linux experience is a direct gap against the job description's call for support across multiple operating systems including Windows, macOS, and Linux. While you don't have this experience, the original resume didn't acknowledge it or present your Windows foundation as a learning platform.

**Regarding Relocation:** The job description explicitly states 'Work Location: Remote', therefore, relocation is not required.`,

Job Description:

Instructions:
Take this resume and job description and tailor the resume for this job while being brutally honest and nit picking where needs be for the highest success rate at job retention and callback from future employer prospects.

I am pivoting my career from 5 years of remote operations, logistics, and claims management into my first IT Support/Help Desk role. I need you to tailor my base resume to fit the specific job description provided.

Here are my strict rules for this rewrite:

1. Keep it Human: Do not use overly robotic, flowery, or clichÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â© AI terminology (e.g., avoid words like 'spearheaded,' 'synergized,' 'visionary,' or 'unparalleled'). Use a formal, professional, yet grounded tone that sounds like a real, hardworking person.
2. Honesty is Key: Do not stretch the truth, fabricate metrics, or invent enterprise IT experience I do not have. I want to be entirely open about my background.
3. Focus on the Pivot: Frame my work history honestly: I am a career changer armed with highly transferable soft skills, including strict SLA management, high-stakes client de-escalation, and field troubleshooting.
4. Highlight My Practical Tech Skills: Emphasize my hands-on technical foundation through my Self-Hosted Enterprise Service Desk Lab, Active Directory/RBAC experience, and my current active studies for my CompTIA A+ certification.
5. Tailor to the JD: Carefully read the provided job description. Rearrange my bullet points and highlight the specific transferable skills and lab projects from my base resume that directly answer the employer's requirements.
6. Absolute Contact Integrity: Under no conditions should you alter or replace the candidate's real name (${profile.name || "Michael Burson"}), phone (${profile.phone || "740.755.0345"}), email (${profile.email || "mburson99@gmail.com"}), portfolio website (${profile.website || "https://github.com/mburson99-arch"}), or LinkedIn link (https://linkedin.com/in/michaelburson). Keep them exactly identical in the header of the tailored document.
7. GitHub Selection: If multiple GitHub profiles are supplied, choose the one that best matches the target job. Use only one GitHub/portfolio URL in the tailored resume header.
${customParamText}
${promptOverrideBlock}
${critiquePromptBlock}

You MUST respond strictly in a valid JSON format with the following keys:
1. "brutallyHonestCritique": Provide a detailed, transparent, and direct critique of the original resume. Point out exactly where they sound junior, where their skills are lacking compared to the job description, where their descriptions lack impact, and how they failed to describe their actual depth. Speak frankly and professionally ("brutally honest"). Use Markdown. Include in this critique a prominent note if the job explicitly requires relocation based on the JD.
2. "tailoredResume": A complete, expertly formatted Markdown version of the tailored resume. YOU MUST USE EXACT MARKDOWN HEADERS (# Name, ## PROFESSIONAL SUMMARY, ## TECHNICAL SKILLS, ## EXPERIENCE) for all sections. DO NOT just bold section names. The lack of standard ## headers ruins the format. Follow the pivot instructions strictly. Avoid plain-text 1990s aesthetics. IMPORTANT FOR LINKS: NEVER hide URLs behind Markdown text links (e.g., do NOT use \`[LinkedIn](https://linkedin.com/...)\`). Always write out the full URL so it remains fully visible to the reader (e.g., \`LinkedIn: https://linkedin.com/...\`). The raw URLs MUST be visible in the text so recruiters viewing the printed PDF can read them.
3. "matchScore": An estimated match score percentage (integer between 0 and 100) based on alignment with the JD after styling.
4. "suggestedSkills": A string array of top crucial technical skills that were highlighted or added to alignment.
5. "estimatedMatchExplanation": A brief 1-2 sentence explanation of why the tailored resume will successfully pass ATS systems and recruiters.
6. "requiresRelocation": A boolean indicating if the job description specifically states that relocation is required or expected.
7. "aiResponse": A conversational response directed to the user acknowledging their custom instructions, answering any questions they asked in the custom instructions, and explaining the specific changes made based on their request. If no custom instructions were given, just leave empty or provide a very short introductory statement.
8. "selectedGithubUrl": The one GitHub/portfolio URL selected for this job. If no multi-profile option is supplied, return the profile's default portfolio URL.
9. "githubSelectionReason": A short explanation for why that GitHub was the best fit for this job.

DO NOT output any wrapping markdown or text other than the valid parseable JSON. Ensure all quotes are escaped properly.
